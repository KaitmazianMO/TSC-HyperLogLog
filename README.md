# TSoC-HyperLogLog


This summer, I participated in the student program of the Tarantool team called Tarantool Summer of Code. I worked on an implementation of the HyperLogLog algorithm.
This repository contains the results of my work, and I hope that you will learn something new by studying this code. There are a lot of comments so I think you will figure out.

If you have any questions, you can try to find answers or ask them in my implementation [post](https://habr.com/ru/company/vk/blog/711126/).
